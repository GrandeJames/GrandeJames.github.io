## Getting Started in Coding

I started coding when I was young (maybe 6th, 7th, or even 8th grade). I remember the exact moment when I got hooked into it. I was playing a game called Minecraft with my friend, and we were on my own server. Iâ€™m not exactly sure what made me want to code, but I remember the feeling of when my code worked. I simply had a listener that listened for player movement, and so when a player moved, it typed out a funny message in chat. I was full of excitement and shock, and I was hooked from there. I taught myself some basic Java and created several other Minecraft plugins from there. I even sold copies of a plugin, where I unfortunately experience a terrible customer (who was wrong at the end).

## Pursuing Web Development

I stopped coding (on my own free time) in High School but started again around my 1st year in college. I wanted to improve my coding skills and looked for a good resource to do that. There I found the online curriculum called The Odin Project where I am learning web development. Because of that I am mainly pursuing the path of web development. 
 
## Necessary Skills

I want to be a great software engineer. To do that, I should learn to be a great communicator, writer, and coder. I also need to further my learning in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, frameworks, libraries, and more. I hope to be able to write big and complex code one day.
