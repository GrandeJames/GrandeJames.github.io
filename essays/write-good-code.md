## What is it?

What are coding standards? Coding standards are a way of writing code. When first learning to code, you not only learn the logic (e.g. conditionals) but also how to actually write the code and piece them together. Coding standards help you write cleaner and more readable code for you and, most importantly, others.

## Correct Ways to Code

Coding standards result in higher quality code that is easier to read and less prone to errors. For example, when indenting the next line of an if-statement, the indentation lets you know that the indented line inside is what is to be run if the if-statement is true. Another example (at least in Java) is not having to write curly brackets for a one-line statement after an if-statement. The code still compiles, but many, if not everyone, recommend that you should still add curly braces to make it easy to expand if necessary. Both of these examples will still work, but it’s not good quality code because it’s harder to read.

## Code Readability

These coding standards or recommended rules of writing code are critical in programming because it allows you and others to read it easily. Having coding standards sets rules and allows code to be consistent and organized throughout a whole project which is especially useful when you are working with others. It makes it so that everyone has the same way of writing that lets the other person quickly read your code and vice versa.
