## In the beginning stage

I started my learning of web development in the summer of last year (2021) through an online curriculum called The Odin Project (TOP). There I began my journey to to becoming a web developer. To become a web developer, it requires you to learn HTML (the building blocks), CSS (styling), JavaScript (control), and more. I have already learned some HTML and CSS from high school, but it was fast paced, and I was unable to learn it thoroughly and in depth. Through TOP, I learned some web development including the fundamentals and a bit of intermediate JavaScript.

## My thoughts on JavaScript as a beginner

In the software engineering world we are constantly comparing which technology to use. So is JavaScript the best programming language? I don’t know. At least not yet. But from the little time that I have been learning JavaScript, I have learned some things about it that sets it apart (at least from what I know compared to Java and C/C++). I think JavaScript is powerful, flexible, yet still simple. JavaScript compared to Java and C/C++ is very function oriented (functional programming instead of object-oriented programming languages). In JavaScript, you can have functions in functions. You also have anonymous functions. It is loose and less structured. Furthermore, JavaScript have nice features. For example, you have array methods like .map(), .reduce(), etc. which are really useful. JavaScript also has other cool features like destructuring. I still consider myself a beginner to these programming languages, but I’ve been enjoying JavaScript so far.

## Best way to learn programming or anything

There’s a lot to learn in web development including JavaScript, and it is important to do so efficiently. And to do that, I completely believe in practice just like many others. Something I’ve been introduced to recently is athletic software engineering. It involves practice, but the main difference is that it’s timed! I have done something like it before when practicing math problems to assure that I don’t take too long if I get stuck, but the difference is the pressure with it. You must complete a task correctly and on time, and you either receive all the points or nothing. It’s all or nothing. I do think this way learning is effective, and is an amazing way to prepare for coding interviews. I think the only difference is that you’re not verbally explaining what you’re doing.
